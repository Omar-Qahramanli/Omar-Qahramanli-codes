                I am a programmer, I develop websites. In November 2018, I was approached
                by a German startup. We discussed the terms and agreed that they would
                transfer the payment in dollars to me on check.

            <h2>What is currency control?</h2>

                In Russia, all foreign exchange transactions are subject to regulation.
                When a payment comes from abroad, the Government and the Central Bank
                must be sure that the money is received legally.
